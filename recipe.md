1.)we are going to go milk a cow in italy. Then we get dough from the fresh acres of the netherlands. We get a grinder from the baker named mario accros the street from the colluseoum in italy.

2.)then, we go back home, and wish that you were at italy longer and now you start cooking. 

3.) You will take the wheat and milk and dough and you will make flour, and that is the primary resource of the pizza

4.) then you preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

5.) then you put the dough/mixture in the oven for it to heat up

6.) mid way, take out the dough and add the topings like cheese, and tomatoes.
